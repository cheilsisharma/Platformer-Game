 2D Platformer Game with Enemy AI

Welcome to 2D platformer game repository! This game is a simple yet engaging project that includes the following features:

1. **Player Movement:**
   - Players can control the character with basic movement actions, including running, walking, and jumping.

2. **Level Design:**
   - The game offers a single level with placeholder assets and a few platforms to navigate.

3. **Enemy with Basic AI:**
   - Encounter one enemy with simplistic AI. The enemy patrols on a platform, and players will immediately die upon contact. The game over screen will appear in this case.

4. **Basic UI:**
   - The game starts with a basic user interface (UI) that includes Start and Quit buttons for easy navigation.

5. **Game Over Screen:**
   - When the player comes into contact with the enemy or other hazardous objects (e.g., spikes), the player will immediately die, and a game over UI screen will be displayed, providing an option to restart the game.
